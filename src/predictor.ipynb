It handles scaling for numerical features, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and conversion for boolean features.\n- `height_to_inches`: A helper function to convert height from a string format to inches.\n- `_create_sequences_for_group`: This function takes data for a single player in a single play and transforms it into sequences of a fixed length (`SEQUENCE_LENGTH`), which is the required input format for an LSTM model.\n- `load_and_prepare_data`: The main data pipeline function. It reads the raw CSVs, merges them, performs feature engineering (e.g., calculating age), fits and applies the preprocessor, creates sequences using `_create_sequences_for_group`, and finally splits the data into training and validation sets, returning them as `tf.data.Dataset` objects.","metadata":{}},{"id":"i5j6k7l8","cell_type":"code","source":"def get_feature_label_specs(dataset):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the feature and label specifications from a TensorFlow Dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        dataset (tf.data.Dataset): The TensorFlow Dataset.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the feature and label specifications.\n               (feature_spec, label_spec)\n    \"\"\"\n    element_spec = dataset.element_spec\n    return element_spec[0], element_spec[1]\n\ndef create_preprocessor(features_df: pd.DataFrame):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a preprocessor for the NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 prediction data.\n\n    Args:\n        features_df (pd.DataFrame): The dataframe with the features.\n\n    Returns:\n        ColumnTransformer: The preprocessor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify column types from the dataframe\n    numerical_features = features_df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()\n    categorical_features = features_df.select_dtypes(exclude=np.number).columns.tolist()\n\n    # Ensure boolean 'player_to_predict' is handled separately if it's not numeric\n    boolean_features = []\n    if 'player_to_predict' in categorical_features:\n        categorical_features.remove('player_to_predict')\n        boolean_features.append('player_to_predict')\n    elif 'player_to_predict' in numerical_features:\n        numerical_features.remove('player_to_predict')\n        boolean_features.append('player_to_predict')\n        \n    # Remove identifiers that should not be model features\n    ids_to_remove = ['game_id', 'play_id', 'frame_id']\n    for col in ids_to_remove:\n        if col in numerical_features:\n            numerical_features.remove(col)\n        if col in categorical_features:\n            categorical_features.remove(col)\n\n    boolean_features = ['player_to_predict']\n\n    numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[\n        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')),\n        ('scaler', StandardScaler())\n    ])\n    categorical_transformer = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)\n    boolean_transformer = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x.fillna(0).astype(int))\n\n    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(\n        transformers=[\n            ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_features),\n            ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features),\n            ('bool', boolean_transformer, boolean_features)\n        ],\n        remainder='drop'\n    )\n\n    return preprocessor\n\ndef height_to_inches(height_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts height string 'feet-inches' to inches.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(height_str, str):\n        feet, inches = map(int, height_str.split('-'))\n        return feet * 12 + inches\n    return np.nan\n\nSEQUENCE_LENGTH = 10\ndef _create_sequences_for_group(group_df: pd.DataFrame, sequence_length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates sequences of features and corresponding labels for a single player/play group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The group is already sorted by frame_id from the previous step\n    num_frames = len(group_df)\n    if num_frames < sequence_length + 1:\n        return np.array([]), np.array([])\n\n    # Extract features and labels as numpy arrays\n    feature_cols = [col for col in group_df.columns if col not in ['game_id', 'play_id', 'nfl_id', 'frame_id', 'x_label', 'y_label']]\n    features_array = group_df[feature_cols].values\n    labels_array = group_df[['x_label', 'y_label']].values\n\n    sequences = []\n    labels = []\n\n    # Number of complete sequences that can be formed\n    num_sequences = num_frames -
